## About

This is a simple tool used by Wendy (https://github.com/tinybird/Wendy) to download iTC reports. The code that does the actual download comes from AppSales-Mobile by Ole Zorn (https://github.com/omz/AppSales-Mobile). Eventually, it would be nice to refactor the upstream code so it can be used directly to build a command-line tool for OS X but this will have to do for now.
